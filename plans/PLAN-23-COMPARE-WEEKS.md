# Plan 23: Compare Weeks

**Status: ✅ Complete** · **Priority: P1** · **Effort: Medium** · **Impact: High**

## Problem

Comparing two weeks side-by-side (e.g. "last week vs this week") would help spot trends and prepare for reviews.

## Tasks

1. [ ] Add "Compare" mode or route (e.g. `/history/compare?week1=2026-W05&week2=2026-W06`)
2. [ ] Load both weeks' payloads and summaries
3. [ ] Side-by-side or stacked layout: metrics table, summary text
4. [ ] Highlight deltas (e.g. PRs merged: 5 → 7, +2)

## Success Criteria

- User can view two weeks side-by-side
- Metrics and content differences are easy to see
