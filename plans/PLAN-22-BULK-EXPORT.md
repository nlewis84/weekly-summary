# Plan 22: Bulk Export

**Status: ✅ Complete** · **Priority: P2** · **Effort: Medium** · **Impact: Medium**

## Problem

Exporting one week at a time is tedious for users who want to archive or share multiple weeks. Bulk export would support year-end reviews or portfolio prep.

## Tasks

1. [ ] Add "Export selected" or "Export all" on History index
2. [ ] Let user select date range or check multiple weeks
3. [ ] Generate ZIP with .md files (or combined document)
4. [ ] Optional: include CSV of metrics for selected weeks

## Success Criteria

- User can export multiple weeks in one action
- Output is usable (ZIP of markdown or single combined file)
