# Plan 29: Annual Dashboard

**Status: ✅ Complete** · **Priority: P4** · **Effort: High** · **Impact: High**

## Problem

Users have `2025-annual-review.md` and year-over-year data. An annual view (aggregate metrics, trends, top repos) would support reviews and goal-setting.

## Tasks

1. [ ] Add `/annual` or `/history/annual` route
2. [ ] Aggregate metrics across all weeks in selected year
3. [ ] Charts: yearly trend (PRs, reviews, Linear over months)
4. [ ] Top repos, top Linear projects
5. [ ] Link to individual weeks from annual view
6. [ ] Support multiple years (2024, 2025, 2026)

## Success Criteria

- User can view annual aggregate metrics and trends
- Data drives year-end reviews and planning
