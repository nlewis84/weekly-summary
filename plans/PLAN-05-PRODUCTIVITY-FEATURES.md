| **Quick stats copy** | Copy "PRs merged: 3, Reviews: 5…" for standup/slack | Low |

### Medium Value

| **Calendar integration** | Add summary to Google Calendar / iCal | High |

## Recommended First Batch

1. **Copy stats to clipboard** – Button on MetricsCard / TodaySection
2. **Copy full markdown** – Button after generating (or on week detail page)
3. **Keyboard shortcut** – `r` to refresh data
4. **Last built timestamp** – Store in localStorage or from API, show near form

## Tasks

1. [ ] Add "Copy stats" button to TodaySection and/or MetricsCard
2. [ ] Add "Copy markdown" on week detail page and after successful build
3. [ ] Implement `r` keyboard shortcut for refresh (with `useEffect` + keydown)
4. [ ] Add "Last built" display (from summary action response or localStorage)
5. [ ] Document shortcuts in UI (e.g. tooltip or `?` modal)

## Success Criteria

- Users can quickly copy metrics for standups/slack
- Power users can use keyboard for refresh
- Clear feedback when copy succeeds (toast or inline message)
