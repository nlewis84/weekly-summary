# 2026 Weekly Work Summaries

Generated by `weekly-summary.js`. One JSON + one Markdown file per week (named by week-ending date).

## Purpose

- **Source of truth** for end-of-year review and career narrative.
- **Career level-up**: Document leadership, ownership, mentoring, cross-team work, and technical impact exactly as they occurred. Use the data here (completed issues, merged PRs, reviews, check-ins) to surface evidence when reviewing for level-up.

## Files per week

- `YYYY-MM-DD.json` — Full structured data (stats, linear issues, PRs, check-ins, terminal output). Easy to parse programmatically.
- `YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Human-readable summary and terminal output.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-week-in-review.md` — Week-in-review video transcript for that Friday. Paste your transcript into the file (create one if it doesn’t exist for a given week).

## JSON shape

- `meta`: generated_at, window_start, window_end, week_ending, source_of_truth
- `stats`: prs_merged, prs_total, pr_reviews, linear_completed, linear_worked_on, repos
- `linear`: completed_issues, worked_on_issues, in_review, in_progress (each item: identifier, title, project, url, completedAt, state)
- `github`: merged_prs, open_prs, reviews, comments_count
- `check_ins`: [{ day, content }]
- `terminal_output`, `formatted_output`: plain text (no ANSI)

## Week-in-review transcripts

**Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-week-in-review.md` (Friday’s date). For new weeks, create a file with the same pattern.

**Format (keep this structure when pasting):**

1. **First line:** `# Week in review — YYYY-MM-DD (Friday)`
2. **Blank line**
3. **Transcript:** Each line starts with a timestamp `M:SS` (e.g. `0:00`, `1:23`) followed by a space and the spoken text. No other formatting required.
4. **Multiple segments:** Separate different recordings or segments with a line containing only `---`.

Example:

```markdown
# Week in review — 2026-01-30 (Friday)

0:00 Hey everybody, this is my weekly video...
0:07 First thing I'll call out, I do have 5 PRs...
1:05 So, all right, let's do a quick demo.
---
0:00 [Second segment if needed]
```
