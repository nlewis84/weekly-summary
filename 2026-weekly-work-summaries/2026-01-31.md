More info re: what we had previously identified as Time to paint issues
Time to paint issues is actually a misidentification. We have seen, and cataloged, very impressive responsiveness in time to paint across Web. The things that are really slowing down Web are Vercel Cold Functions. Vincent WilsonVincent rightly pointed out to me that this problem gbetter with scale (not worse). We've also pushed up some changes to our Vercel instance (Fluid Compute and bundle reduction) to improve performance even more. As we test Web Giving, for the time being I believe that we may see occasional blips of "long load times", but we should see that improve on subsequent requests across the app. These changes will probably go live in full to production tomorrow.
